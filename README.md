I developed a billing software application with a user-friendly interface using Python (Tkinter) and SQLite3 as the backend. The system is divided into three main portals:

Admin Portal: Secured with login credentials (ID & password), this portal allows admins to add, update, or delete items, view inventory, access bill summaries, monitor activity logs, and analyze business trends through a dashboard for real-time insights.

Customer Portal: Enables users to browse and purchase items either manually or through QR code scanning for a faster shopping experience. It offers a streamlined interface for smooth transaction processing.

About Us Section: Provides a concise description of the project, its features, and the technologies used.

The software enhances retail efficiency by integrating inventory control, sales tracking, and QR-based purchasing, all within a single desktop application.
